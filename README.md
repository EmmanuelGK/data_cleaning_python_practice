# data_cleaning_python_practice
Aproject to practice cleaning data in python 
This repo is just me rolling up my sleeves and playing with a dirty dataset i got from kaggle. Nothing too fancy, nothing over-polished ,  just straight data wrangling, cleaning, and a bit of engineering to make sense of things.
**************************************************************
 What I Did
 ***********************************************************

Imported the dataset (CSV from my machine, not cloud magic).

Looked at the mess → missing values, duplicates, weird text in columns.

Cleaned up the Stars column → split it into stars and ratings because mixing them felt wrong.

Converted time into minutes (hours are cool but minutes give me precision).

Engineered new columns from dates → year, month, day, day_name, is_weekend, hour, time_of_day.

Did basic sanity checks with .info(), .describe(), .unique() just to see what’s hiding in there.

***************************************************
 Why This Repo Exists
 
***************************************************

To sharpen my pandas and data cleaning chops.

To leave behind a trail of code I can build on later.

To keep this code as a reminder of my ealier days of writting python code and compare to see progress and possible see the trail of thought.

To get myself ready for ML ZOOMCAMP TUTORIAL to makesure that I'm not lost and avoid too much errors while learning machine learning.

**************************************************
 Next Steps
*************************************

Do some groupby explorations (like: which day of the week gets more ratings, what genres are weekend favorites).

Maybe build visuals in the next phase (matplotlib/Power BI).

********************************************************
 Vibe
 ********************************
 

Straightforward. A bit messy. But practical. If you’re also learning, you’ll feel right at home here.
